# Risk Prediction

Mortgages, student and auto loans, and debt consolidation are just a few examples of credit and loans that people seek online. Peer-to-peer lending services such as Loans Canada and Mogo let investors loan people money without using a bank. However, because investors always want to mitigate risk, machine learning will be used as a technique to predict credict risk.

Building and evaluating several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data typically seen from peer-to-peer lending services. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans), different techniques will be employed for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes. Imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques:

1. Resampling
2. Ensemble Learning
